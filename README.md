# java-bmi-calculator
This project was inspired by John Purcell's Java for Complete Beginners course. 

It uses the Scanner class to get input from the user.

The source of the Body Mass Index (BMI) is the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as cited in the ISSA textbook (see below).

Feel free to use this code in any way you wish (college assignments, teaching, etc). Attribution would be nice as a matter of courtesy, however, it is not necessary.

I have tested it and it works fine. I did take some liberties with values, especially at the lower end of each category. Feel free to make improvements. Make a note of the amendments you made especially if you need to submit evidence of work.

While the code is largely based on using imperial units, you may wish to develop it to use metric units if you use the metric system.

To quote John Purcell, "Happy coding!"
